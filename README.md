# ThreeHouses
#This project uses data from characters from one of my favorite strategy video games, Fire Emblem: Three Houses. In this game, you choose around 10 characters from a pool of about 40 characters to fight with you throughout the game. I created this project so that I could compare the statistics of each character to inform my decision of who may be best to choose.
#Every character has a BASE and GROWTH stat for nine different stats: HP, Strength, Magic, Dexterity, Speed, Luck, Defense, Resistance, and Charm. For example, every character has a BASE HP stat and a corresponding GROWTH HP stat.
#Your BASE stat is the number you start with at Level 1. Your GROWTH stat is the probability that you will gain one point in that stat each time you level up. For example, if my BASE HP is 5 and my GROWTH HP is 50, there is a 50 percent chance I will grow from 5 HP to 6 HP upon leveling up.
#Taking the above information into consideration, I wanted to make a program that could compare which of the 40 characters would be the strongest (on average) after leveling up 30 times.
